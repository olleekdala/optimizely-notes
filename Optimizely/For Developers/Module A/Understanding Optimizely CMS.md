Why use a CMS?
- Easy for non-technical people to create professional well-structured content.
- Flexible access control lists for applying permissions to content
- Localize content into multiple human languages
- Control publishing workflow and multiple versions

# Welcome
[Collaboration platform](https://www.optimizely.com/products/content-marketing)
Rebranded as **Content Marketing Platform**, used to be **Welcome**

- Campaigns, calendars, tasks, workflow, work requests
- Digital Asset Management
- Content Editor sync with CMS
- Marketing performance analytics

Used by customers to plan and reduce requests for developers to make edits in the CMS, because customers use the CMS editing interface less or not at all if using the collaboration tool.
