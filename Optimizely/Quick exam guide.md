1. Familiarize yourself with the content and layout of [the CMS developer documentation](https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/content-management-system/docs) and the [Digital Experience Platform (DXP) documentation](https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/digital-experience-platform/docs)
2. Follow the course material for **Optimizely CMS 12 - development fundamentals**
	*This repository contains my notes for this course. Please add your own remarks and insights if necessary.*
3. Go through the [[Exam Guide Checklist]] to identify areas in the exam guide you may be missing information about. The [[Certification Reference]] contains links to the docs on the respective areas in the exam guide. **Note that it does link to CMS 11 docs, remove the /v11.0.0/ in the path to get the latest CMS 12 docs.**

While the main course will give you an introduction to the major concepts involved in the Optimizely CMS, it misses some parts that I encountered on the exam.

The major areas lacking in the course is about **Deployment**. While there is a section in module G that covers some details about deployment, almost none of it was relevant for the questions I had on the exam.
A lot of questions were about details of the DXP (Digital Experience Platform).

On the exam you have about 1.2 minutes per question, you can spend a minute to google a question. I had success googling something specific in the question and prefixing the search with "Optimizely", and finding results leading to the docs sites or forum posts.
