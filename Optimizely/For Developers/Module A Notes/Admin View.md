# Configuration - Manage Websites

Websites are managed and defined here in the Admin view. Each website requires a license, however multiple host names within one site do not. For example multiple language domains mapped to language branches do not require additional licenses.

You can configure website settings here like name and URL.

# Change Log

Logs all changes within the CMS automatically for admins to audit.
