These are reports on development stages for pages.
Six available reports:
- Not Published Pages
- Published Pages
- Changed Pages
- Expired Pages
- Simple Addresses
- Link Status

Most of these are self-explanatory: Not Published Pages produce a report of pages that have not been published yet, etc etc.

**Expired Pages** are pages that have been set as expired on a schedule or manually. An expired page is not available on the website.

**Simple Addresses** are shortcuts to content pages by assigning them a "simple address" which can be used instead of a more lengthy path to the content.

**Link Status** is a report of broken links. It can prompt you to run the **Link Validation** Scheduled Jobs before generating the report to update available data.
