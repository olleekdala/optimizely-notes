You can control the publishing of content in a number of ways.

- Setting **StartPublish** and **StopPublish** properties on content. Content is visible to visitors if the current datetime is within the start and stop. StopPublish can be set to null, if so the content will never cease to be visible.
- Schedule content to be published at a later date.
	- **Publish Scheduled Content Version** scheduled job is responsible for publishing content with a scheduled date. It runs each hour by default. This could mean a piece of content could, with the default setting, be delayed an hour past the scheduled datetime because the job has not run yet.
- **Tools | Manage Expiration and Archiving** allows setting **StopPublish**. When a page passes the expire date it will no longer be considered published and return a 404 code.
