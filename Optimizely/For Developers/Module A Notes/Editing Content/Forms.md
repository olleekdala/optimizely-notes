 #Editor #Devs 

Forms is an add-on and behaves like Blocks or Media, and is therefore accessible from the Assets pane in Edit View.

As an add-on, you have to install the NuGet package `EPiServer.Forms` to include it in the project.

Some included Form Elements are Text and Selection, developers can define their own by deriving from **ElementBlockBase**.

***It is recommended to consider your use case of forms before you end up in a very complex solution with advanced customization in code, rather than using the standard elements of the Optimizely Forms.***
