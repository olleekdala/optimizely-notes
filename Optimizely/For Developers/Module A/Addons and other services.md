## Useful third party addons
[**404 Handler for EPiServer**](https://github.com/Geta/geta-notfoundhandler)
The popular NotFound handler for ASP.NET Core and Optimizely, enabling better control over your 404 page in addition to allowing redirects for old URLs that no longer works.
The perfect companion if you're transitioning to your site from another system and cannot keep the URL structure, or plan to do major re-structuring of your content.

[**Optimizely Categories**](https://github.com/Geta/geta-optimizely-categories)
An alternative to Optimizely's default category functionality, where categories are instead stored as localizable IContent.
