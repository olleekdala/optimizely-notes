### Links
### Shortcuts
Determines how the system should respond to a click on the link rendered for the current page, and a handy property fallback capability.

Links can be in a Rich Text property, or automatically generated menu.

Options for shortcuts:
- **No Shortcut**: Default, link to original page.
- **Shortcut to another content item**: Link is to another page or media asset.
- **Shortcut to page on another website**: Link to URL
- **No shortcut, display text only**
- **Fetch content from another content item**: The link is still to the original page, e.g. Alloy Go (demo site) but when property values are empty (null) then they can be read from the shortcut as a fallback.

### Shared Blocks
Small pieces of content that can be dragged-and-dropped anywhere on the website.

### Content Areas
An ordered collection of content references to pages, media, blocks, forms, even folders.
