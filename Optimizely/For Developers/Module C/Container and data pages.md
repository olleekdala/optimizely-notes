Technically all pages are container pages since they can all be parent to other pages. When explicitly using the term **Container Page** it is more commonly meant to refer to a page with no content, other than children pages, and is not rendered to visitors.

They have no template, and sort of act as a folder in the page tree.

**Data Pages** are similar in that they also have no template, with the additional difference of also not having any children, they only contain and provide data for their parent page.

Creating a **Container Page** simply by creating a page type without a page template.
