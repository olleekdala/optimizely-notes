Options available for publishing:
- A/B Test Changes
- Ready to Publish
- Schedule for Publish
- Revert to Published

#### A/B Test Changes
Publish changes with the A/B testing strategy to temporarily give some users the new changes to measure the impact any changes has on users. 

You can set goals and metrics to determine which site is more successful.
Set a participation percentage, how many of the users accessing this page will get the new change.
Set test duration and also schedule or immediately publish changes.
#### Ready to Publish
Sets changes to ready to publish, to publish for a later date.
#### Schedule for Publish
Set a later time and date to publish changes. Useful if you have a lot of work to publish and instead of publishing individual pages, you can instead set all changes to publish on a scheduled date.
#### Revert to Published
Reverts all changes to previously published version.

### Approval Sequence
If you want to configure the process of approving changes and publications, you can do so by clicking the ellipsis icon on a page, and selecting **Edit Approval Sequence**.

By default a page will inherit the approval sequence from their parent page, so you would most likely set up a generic sequence for Root, or Home, and if you need to specify a more detailed or exceptions in the sequence, you can do so for individual pages as well. 

Setting an approval sequence will disable any option to publish from the publishing menu, instead you will have the option for **Ready for Review**
