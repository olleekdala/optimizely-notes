#Devs 
This module is covered in the notes section for [[Editing Interface]] 
It appears the course material available from the "Development Fundamentals" course is slightly less updated than for the "CMU Usage".

This course rushes through the editing interface explanations as well, so for a full understanding of the editing and admin interfaces, watching both or focusing on the CMU Usage course instead is probably recommended.
