Also known as "Visitor Groups".

Can be used to set up permissions for users accessing the site to view certain content.
For example you can set up so only Audience A can view a page, and users are bucketed into Audience A based on custom **criteria** set up for the audience in the settings.  
#### Criteria
There are many criterion to customize an audience with.
A User will be bucketed into an audience if they match the criterion set, either matching
- All
- Any
- Points

Matching **All** the user must meet all criteria set.
**Any** means the user must meet at least one criteria.
**Points** is a more complex match. You set a points threshold to be matched, and each criteria is worth a custom number of points.
If you match any number of criteria with a points sum of more than the threshold, you're bucketed into the audience.
