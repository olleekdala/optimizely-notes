The course will walk through a pre-built demo site, and end with building one from scratch.
The sites are based on the .NET MVC.

To get started with your own sites, Optimizely provides two starter sites for the CMS:
#### Frontline Services
[Github](https://github.com/episerver/foundation-mvc-cms/tree/main)
This starter site includes a single project with add-ons pre-installed for the CMS.
#### Mosey
[Github](https://github.com/episerver/Foundation/tree/main)
This is a Commerce starter site, with multiple projects.
