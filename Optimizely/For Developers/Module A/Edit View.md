#Devs #ModuleA 
This module is covered in the notes section for [[Editing Interface]] 
It appears the course material available from the "Development Fundamentals" course is slightly less updated than for the "CMU Usage".

This course rushes through the editing interface explanations as well, so for a full understanding of the editing and admin interfaces, watching both or focusing on the CMU Usage course instead is probably recommended.

### Deleting Content
All CMS content can be moved to the **Trash**
The **Administer** access right is required to work with items in the Trash.
The **Automatic Emptying of Trash** scheduled job runs every week and permanently deletes items in the trash that have been there for more than 30 days.
Admins and roles with the **Administer** access right can empty trash at any time. They can also choose to restore items from the Trash.

Trash is called **Recycle Bin** in the **Set Access Rights** settings.
In Scheduled Jobs it is called **Trash**.
In code it is called **Wastebasket**.
